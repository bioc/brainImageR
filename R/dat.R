#' In vitro temporal data of human neural progenitor cells and neurons
#'
#' @description RNA-seq data: Induced pluripotent stem cells were differentiated
#' into neural progenitor cells (NPC.1, NPC.2, NPC.3, NPC.4) that were patterned
#' for the forebrain lineage. Neurons were differentiated from
#' these neural progenitor cells (Neurons.5, Neurons.6).
#' RNA was collected from both NPCs and neurons,
#' poly(A) cDNA libraries were generated, and sequenced
#' on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
#' RNA-seq data was aligned to the human Hg19 reference, and counts were
#' normalized into log2(TPM + 1) values. Gene names are in human symbol format.
